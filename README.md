# Online Reservation System
file: ReservationSystem.java
Task: This Online Reservation System will include all the necessary fields which are required during online reservation system. This Online Reservation System will be easy to use and can be used by any person. The basic idea behind this project is to save data in a central database which can be accessed by any authorize person to get information and saves time and burden which are being faced by their customers.

Login Form – To access this Online Reservation System, each user should have a valid login id and password. After providing the correct login id and password, users will able to access the main system.

Reservation System – Under reservation form users will have to fill the necessary details such as their basic details, train number, train name will automatically come in the box, class type, date of journey, from (place) to destination and after that, users will have to press insert button.

Cancellation Form – If passengers want to cancel their tickets then they have to provide their PNR number and after submitting it, this will display the entire information related to that particular PNR number. If users want to confirm their cancellation, in this case they have to press OK button.

Execution: The Train Reservation System is a Java Swing-based application that facilitates train travel management. The program begins with a secure login interface, requiring a valid username and password for access. Once authenticated, users can interact with a user-friendly main interface to perform key actions. The system allows users to insert new reservation records by providing passenger details, selecting a train, specifying class type, and entering journey information. It enforces data integrity, including a reminder for the correct date format (yyyy-mm-dd). The cancellation feature enables users to remove reservations by entering the Passenger Name Record (PNR) number, with confirmation prompts. The program employs object-oriented principles, including the use of ArrayLists to manage reservations efficiently. Overall, it serves as a practical tool for users to manage and view their train reservations seamlessly.
# Number Guessing Game
file:NumberGuessingGame.java
Task: The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
The game continues under the user guessing the number.
You can also incorporate further details as:

Limiting the number of attempts.
Adding more rounds.
Displaying score.
Giving points based on the number of attempts.

Execution: I've developed an Enhanced Number Guessing Game in Java, expanding on the traditional guessing game by incorporating features like informative rules, difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), and a play-again option. The game's user interface is implemented using JOptionPane, offering a visually appealing and interactive experience. Real-time feedback guides players through the guessing process, and the final score is calculated based on their performance.
